# Calender

Desktop python app that can provide the advanced functionalities that are not generally available in the default calendar module.

The application design follows the below guidelines: <br />

  The application is able to run with or without command line parameters. <br />
  When the application is run without command line parameters, it simply prints the current month’s calendar with current date highlighted. <br />
  The Month and Year appears on the top (for example, May 2020) <br />
  The Days appears in the next row (for example: Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa) <br />
  The full calendar of the month appears as follows: <br />

  With the commandline argument, the month is changed based on the commandline integer argument. That is, with -1, same date previous month will be printed and +5, same date, 5 months later will be printed
